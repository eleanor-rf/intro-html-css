    <p>Rabbits should eat a diet that consists mostly of hay, but they can sometimes eat a healthy treat. Introduce any new foods gradually and in small quantities as rabbits have very sensitive digestive systems.</p>
    
    <p>Treat ideas for rabbits include:</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Fresh leafy greens
    <ul><li>Offer a variety of fresh, leafy greens such as kale, rocket, and dandelion leaves. These greens are rich in essential nutrients and provide a tasty treat for rabbits.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Herbs
    <ul><li>Rabbits often enjoy the flavors of herbs like mint, basil, and oregano. These can be provided in small amounts as a flavourful and aromatic treat. Try growing your own at home for extra fun!</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Vegetables
    <ul><li>Provide a selection of rabbit-safe vegetables, such as carrots (in moderation due to sugar content), bell peppers, broccoli, and cucumber. Chop them into bite-sized pieces to make it easier for your rabbit to eat.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Fruits
    <ul><li>While fruits contain natural sugars, they can be offered as occasional treats. Some suitable options include apple slices (without seeds), strawberries, blueberries, and slices of banana. Limit the amount to prevent excessive sugar intake.</li></ul>
    </li>
